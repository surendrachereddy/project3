# Predicting Customer Satisfaction - Identifying Dissatisfied Customers for Santander Bank with Machine Learning

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. 
What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving. In a recent Kaggle competition, 
Santander Bank asks Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. 
Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late. 
In this project, we'll tackle this competition and try to predict whether a customer is satisfied or not using customer data.
